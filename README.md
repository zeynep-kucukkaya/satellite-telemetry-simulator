# Satellite Telemetry Simulator

This project simulates telemetry data generated by a satellite system and demonstrates how such data can be validated, scheduled, and processed in a software environment.

## Project Overview
Satellite systems continuously transmit telemetry data such as temperature, battery level, and signal strength. This project focuses on simulating this behavior using Python.

## Simulated Telemetry Parameters
- Satellite temperature
- Battery level
- Signal strength
- Timestamped data packets

## Features
- Telemetry data generation with realistic ranges
- Data validation for integrity checks
- Configurable sampling intervals
- Telemetry data logging to CSV format
- RTOS-like task scheduling simulation for telemetry, sensor, and communication tasks

## Technologies Used
- Python

## Motivation
This project was developed as part of my self-directed learning process to understand telemetry handling, timing, and task scheduling concepts used in real-time and embedded systems.

## Project Status
- Actively developed and open for improvements
